## FAQs

1. Ramphor Plugin Manager is a fork of TGMPA/TGM-Plugin-Activation. But do you have to keep the original class structure?
=> I don't keep the original class structure. So if you call TGMPA/TGM-Plugin-Activation classes will occur errors. But I have kept TGM-Plugin-Activation helpers and you can use them.
2. Why do you modify TGMPA/TGM-Plugin-Activation source code?
=> I must modify many features in TGMPA/TGM-Plugin-Activation to integrate with [Jankx Framework](https://github.com/jankx/jankx) and the origin source code structure it made difficult to develop. So I have changed the source code structure and follow PSR Coding Standard.
